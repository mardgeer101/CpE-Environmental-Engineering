    "### üå´Ô∏è 2. Air and Water Pollution\n",
    "\n",
    "Pollution remains one of the most serious environmental threats worldwide, especially in rapidly urbanizing and industrializing regions. Air and water pollution not only degrade natural ecosystems but also significantly impact human health and economic productivity. As computer engineers, understanding these issues provides a foundation for developing smart, tech-driven environmental solutions.\n",

    "#### üè≠ Air Pollution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Air pollution refers to the contamination of the atmosphere by harmful gases, particulates, and biological molecules. These pollutants can originate from both human activities and natural processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Pollutants:**  \n",
    "- **Particulate Matter (PM2.5, PM10):** Fine particles that penetrate deep into the lungs  \n",
    "- **Carbon Monoxide (CO):** Colorless gas from incomplete combustion  \n",
    "- **Nitrogen Dioxide (NO‚ÇÇ):** Emitted from vehicles and power plants  \n",
    "- **Sulfur Dioxide (SO‚ÇÇ):** Produced by burning fossil fuels  \n",
    "- **Ozone (O‚ÇÉ):** A secondary pollutant formed by reactions in the atmosphere  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Major Sources:**  \n",
    "- Vehicle emissions (e.g., diesel and gasoline engines)  \n",
    "- Industrial processes and factories  \n",
    "- Biomass burning (e.g., trash, crop residues)  \n",
    "- Construction and mining activities  \n",
    "- Household sources (e.g., charcoal, kerosene)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effects on Health and Environment:**  \n",
    "- Short-term exposure: coughing, throat irritation, eye burning  \n",
    "- Long-term exposure: asthma, lung cancer, heart disease  \n",
    "- Contributes to smog, acid rain, and global warming  \n",
    "- Affects agriculture by reducing crop yield due to ozone exposure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance to CpE:**  \n",
    "Computer engineers can help combat air pollution through:  \n",
    "- **IoT-based Air Quality Monitoring Systems**: Distributed low-cost sensors installed in urban areas  \n",
    "- **AI-powered Prediction Models**: Forecasting pollution levels using historical and real-time data  \n",
    "- **Mobile Applications**: Informing users of real-time AQI and suggesting low-pollution routes  \n",
    "- **Data Visualization Dashboards**: For city governments and the public to make informed decisions\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üíß Water Pollution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Water pollution occurs when harmful contaminants are introduced into natural water bodies, degrading water quality and making it unsafe for human use or aquatic life.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Contaminants:**  \n",
    "- **Biological**: Bacteria, viruses, protozoa  \n",
    "- **Chemical**: Heavy metals (lead, mercury), pesticides, nitrates  \n",
    "- **Physical**: Plastics, sediment, color, temperature change  \n",
    "- **Thermal**: Industrial discharge raising water temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "**Major Sources:**  \n",
    "- Domestic sewage and human waste  \n",
    "- Industrial effluents discharged into rivers and seas  \n",
    "- Agricultural runoff (fertilizers, pesticides)  \n",
    "- Oil spills and marine transport  \n",
    "- Plastic waste and microplastics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effects on Health and Environment:**  \n",
    "- Unsafe drinking water leading to diseases like cholera, dysentery, typhoid  \n",
    "- Eutrophication: excessive nutrients lead to algae bloom, depleting oxygen  \n",
    "- Loss of biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems  \n",
    "- Disruption of livelihoods (fishing, tourism)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance to CpE:**  \n",
    "Computer engineers can address water pollution via:  \n",
    "- **IoT Water Quality Monitoring Systems**: Using sensors for pH, TDS, turbidity, temperature  \n",
    "- **Cloud and Edge Analytics**: Real-time analysis of water quality data  \n",
    "- **Decision Support Systems**: Triggering alerts when contamination is detected  \n",
    "- **GIS-based Pollution Mapping**: Tracking pollution sources and spreading patterns\n",

    "#### üìå Extended Real-World Example:  \n",
    "**Case: Smart Water Monitoring in Laguna de Bay, Philippines**  \n",
    "Researchers deployed a network of floating sensor buoys across the lake to monitor real-time pH, turbidity, and temperature. The data was processed using edge devices and sent to a cloud dashboard, which alerts local government units (LGUs) in case of contamination.  \n",
    "**Impact:** Early warning of waterborne outbreaks and support for fisherfolk in affected areas.\n",

    "#### üß† Why It Matters for BSCpE Students  \n",
    "As future computer engineers, students are in a key position to:  \n",
    "- Combine environmental science with embedded systems  \n",
    "- Apply data analytics to real-world pollution data  \n",
    "- Build efficient, low-cost monitoring tools for developing communities  \n",
    "- Contribute to environmental protection through engineering ethics and innovation\n",
